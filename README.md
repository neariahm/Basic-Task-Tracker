## Extra Challenges

* Let the user remove a task from the list by long-clicking on a task
* Style your app! Bonus points for incorporating Material Design components.
    * Add a divider between each item in the RecyclerView :white_check_mark:
* You can also add extra information for each task. For example, a date for when the task should be completed by, the urgency of the task, and so on.
